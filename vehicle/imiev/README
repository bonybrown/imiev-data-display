Run `../generate-model.rb` with this directory as input to 
generate the C++ code for the `Model` class that
models the data points of a Mitsubishi iMiev.


`pid-defs/` contains the definitions of data points in the model.
This was heavily inspired by https://github.com/slackspace-io/imiev-dbc

`example-logs/` contains example logs generated by the `candump` tool
in the standard linux `can-utils` package. These can be fed into
the built `candisplay` program.
