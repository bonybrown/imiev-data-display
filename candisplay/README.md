# How to Build


## First: Create vehicle model

The code that represents the model for the vehicle data
is generated by the `ruby` script `generate-model.rb`

It accepts the directory containing the `pid-defs` as
input and the directory to put the generated C++ code into as output:
```
../vehicle/generate-model.rb --input ../vehicle/imiev --output .
```


## Linux and similar Unixes

Prerequisites:
* `g++`
* `cmake`
* `libimgui-dev`
* `libsdl2`

To build:
```
make
```

## Raspberry PI


Same prerequisites as above

To build:

First, uncomment out the line in the `Makefile` where it says
> Uncomment this line to compile on raspberry pi with OpenGL ES

Then:
```
make
```

# How to use

The built `candisplay` binary can display
in real-time the data piped to it from `candump`. Eg:

```
candump can0 | ./candisplay
```


You can also replay previously captured `candump` files
back through `candisplay`, though you need to "pace"
the playback using the the `pv` tool. eg:

```
cat ../vehicle/imiev/example-logs/silver.can |  pv --quiet --line-mode  --rate-limit 2000 | ./candisplay
```
